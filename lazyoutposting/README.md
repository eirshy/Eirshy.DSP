# Lazy Outposting
Man, I need MORE iron ore? Fiiine I'll go find a planet for it... After this drink.

Allows your mining facilities to apply to every vein on a planet (or just veins a bit wider than their normal scan radius, if you don't want to cheat too much), and your ocean extractors to work regardless of if you put their feed pipe in some water when you first built them.

Additionally can outfit your contracted mining dwarfves with buckets so they can fetch oil for you.... but only if you also install my other mod, ***VeinityProject***.

All options are toggleable, so you can freely decide just how lazy you want to be.

## Changes

- v1.2.1 Fixed dwarven contracts only working if Haulers are enabled, minor future-proofing
- v1.2.0 Changed miner settings to "gear", migrated Buckets/Haulers, added LongPicks
- v1.1.0 Added support for planet oil mining via *VeinityProject*.
- v1.0.1 fixed nullref error on some bp pastings

## Controls
- Press *PageUp* to cycle forwards in the hauler resource list.
- Press *PageDown* to cycle *backwards* in the hauler resource list.

## Future...
Possibly support for miner blueprint forcing for advanced miners, as well as possible lazy oil
