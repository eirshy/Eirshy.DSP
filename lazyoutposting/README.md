Man, I need MORE iron ore? Fiiine I'll go find a planet for it... After this drink.

Allows your mining facilities to apply to every vein on a planet, and your ocean extractors to work regardless of if you put their feed pipe in some water when you first built them. Or doesn't, as all features here are toggleable in config.

Basically a combination of both GoToNightmare's PlanetaryMining and FlexibleGames's PumpAnywhere, but implemented differently. 

Should also be vaguely more-performant than PlanetaryMining was, but not in a way that would really matter.
