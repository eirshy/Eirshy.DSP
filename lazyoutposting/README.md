# Lazy Outposting
Man, I need MORE iron ore? Fiiine I'll go find a planet for it... After this drink.

Allows your mining facilities to apply to every vein on a planet (or just veins a bit wider than their normal scan radius
, if you don't want to cheat too much), and your ocean extractors to work regardless of if you put their feed pipe in some
water when you first built them.

Additionally can outfit your contracted mining dwarfves with buckets so they can fetch oil for you....
but only if you also install my other mod, ***VeinityProject***.

All options are toggleable, so you can freely decide just how lazy you want to be.

## Changes

- v1.3.5 Fix for miners (broke last version lol)
- v1.3.4 Fix for Water Pumps erroring on placement.
- v1.3.3 Fix for various mk2 miner issues
- v1.3.0 DarkFog Update; Added Shovels

## Controls
- Press *PageUp* to cycle forwards in the hauler resource list.
- Press *PageDown* to cycle *backwards* in the hauler resource list.

## AUTOMATED BUGFIXES
- **v1.3.0 through v1.3.2**:<br />
If you placed any Miner mk2s (or other Vein Collector Stations, *not* Gas Giant Collectors), you can use the Bugfix utility
This will reconnect all your Vein Collectors' Mine/Station components, making the mining speed slider work and resolving any other
, less-obvious issues caused by the Station Component not having bookmarked its paired Miner Component.
This issue is also resolved on affected buildings if you just deconstruct and reconstruct them.
This automated fix is more for "completeness", as this is a bug I introduced into save files.

## Future...
Possibly support for miner blueprint forcing for advanced miners, as well as more proper lazy-oil and better lazy-ocean.
