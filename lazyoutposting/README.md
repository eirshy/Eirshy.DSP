# Lazy Outposting
Man, I need MORE iron ore? Fiiine I'll go find a planet for it... After this drink.

Allows your mining facilities to apply to every vein on a planet, and your ocean extractors to work regardless of if you put their feed pipe in some water when you first built them. Or doesn't, as all features here are toggleable in config.

Additionally can outfit your dedicated mining dwarf-bots with buckets so they can fetch oil for you.... but only if you also install my other mod, ***VeinityProject***.

Basically a combination of both GoToNightmare's PlanetaryMining and FlexibleGames's PumpAnywhere, but implemented differently. 

## Changes

- v1.1.0 Added support for planet oil mining via *VeinityProject*.
- v1.0.1 fixed nullref error on some bp pastings
- v1.0.0 release

## Controls
- Press *PageUp* to cycle forwards in the mining resource list.
- Press *PageDown* to cycle *backwards* in the mining resource list.

## Future...
Possibly support for miner blueprint forcing for advanced miners, as well as possible lazy oil
